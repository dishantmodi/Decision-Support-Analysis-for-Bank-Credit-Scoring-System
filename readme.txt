This is a decision support analysis for a Bank.

One of the initiatives currently being discussed is to implement a new customer evaluation process, 
which will allow the Bank wants to set certain “Preferred Customer” Interest Rates to attract more customers who will potentially have larger savings account balances.

For any new customers who want to open a Savings Account, 
the Bank Senior Leadership would like to be able to predict what the Savings Account balances would be, 
given certain data that is being gathered about each customer, from a newly developed DataMart.

This DataMart includes 3rd party credit score ratings, as well as customers’ credit card account limits. 
The Bank also gathers internal data from the Savings Account Application form, which includes customer’s income, age, education level, Student status.

The CFO wants to know which customer attributes are most favorable to a larger Savings account Balance.

Step 1: Create a set of simple linear regressions of each covariate against the outcome variable and find R2 for each regression.

Step 2: Generate the Full model and find R2 for it. Compare it with all R2 of simple linear regression.

Step 3: Senior Leadership states that the acquisition of third-party credit rating scores is a significant expense for the Bank, 
and is asking if this data is valuable? Based on results from all linear regressions, suggest the business recommendation.
